        <h1 >ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h1>
        <p>The bustling capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa is very much the centre of this diverse and delightful country.

        For a start, it geographically sits in the middle of this large nation and, at 2355m above sea level, occupies an elevated position overseeing large swaths of the rest of the country. The city itself has a population of about 2.7 million people and the urban area of Addis Ababa is home to around 4.8 million people. 
        Addis Ababa is also the cultural hub of Ethiopia, with several important museums stationed here, as well as major universities and many Ethiopian Orthodox sites and treasures. And Addis Ababa is also the business hub of this otherwise very rural country. As such, it’s home to the movers and shakers of this 
        quick developing nation, the young and educated as well as a small but growing middle class.
        and this website is to help you explore the newly inaguarated Entoto and Unity parks that you should visit at atleast once in your life time the website explains different activities that you can do whenever you go to those places and also allows you to reserve the place for different activities. Historically, Entoto Mountain was a palace and the royal court to Emperor Menelik in the 1800s. The mountain serves as the “lung of Addis Ababa” because the dense forest regulates the climate condition of the city. Later, the Ethiopian Prime Minister started Entoto Natural park of Addis Ababa as a tourist attraction . The park is a unique natural sight in a mountain area for relaxation and pleasure. It is at the north edge of Addis Ababa at an altitude of 2600m to 3200 meters. Now, the Park is fully delivering services with many indoor and outdoor adventure and recreational activities. In other words, visitors of the park can get services from the best service providers. Moreover, the recreational adventure and tourist attraction sights also open for visitors. In addition, the park is suitable for families or group visitors to cook by themselves and stay at a tented camp. Likewise, Entoto Park has a standard Amphitheatre and playing ground. the website is easy to navigate and scalable to add more feature in the future and if you have any comment or idea that you think this website should contain don't hesitate to go to to give your comment <a href="contact.html">using this link</a></p>
