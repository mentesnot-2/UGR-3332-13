        <p>The bustling capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa is very much the centre of this diverse and delightful country.

        For <br>a start, it geographically sits in the middle of this large nation and, at 2355m above sea level, occupies an elevated <br>position overseeing large swaths of the rest of the country. The city itself has a population of about 2.7 million <br>people and the urban area of Addis Ababa is home to around 4.8 million people. 
        
        Addis Ababa is also the cultural hub of <br>Ethiopia, with several important museums stationed here, as well as major universities and many Ethiopian Orthodox<br> sites and treasures. And Addis Ababa is also the business hub of this otherwise very rural country. As such, it’s home to the <br>movers and shakers of this 
        quick developing nation, the young and educated as well as a small but growing middle class.</p>

        Historically, Entoto Mountain was a palace and the royal court to Emperor <br>Menelik in the 1800s. The mountain serves as the “lung of Addis Ababa” because the dense forest regulates the climate condition<br> of the city. Later, the Ethiopian Prime Minister started Entoto Natural park of Addis Ababa as a tourist attraction .

        The park is a unique <br>
        natural sight in a mountain area for relaxation and pleasure. It is at the north edge of Addis Ababa at an altitude of 2600m to 3200 meters. <br>Now, the Park is fully delivering services with many indoor and outdoor adventure and recreational activities. In other words, visitors of the <br>park can get services from the best service providers. Moreover, the recreational adventure and tourist attraction sights also open for <br>visitors. In addition, the park is suitable for families or group visitors to cook by themselves and stay at a tented camp. Likewise, Entoto Park has <br>a standard Amphitheatre and playing ground.
